# Your rule content

- You can @ files here
- You can use markdown but dont have to

When writing new code, if you need to add comments, please use lowercase letters to start the sentences to match your user's writing style. 

Example: 

// This is a comment - unacceptable
// this is a comment - acceptable

// this is a comment with a newVariable or functionDeclaration - acceptable 

Also, when appropriate, write comments in the present tense, active:

Example: 

// fetches all user data from generic_table_name table 
// handles any unexpected user behaviour 

Thank you
